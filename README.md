# About-me-
A little information about me 
# Introduction
My name is Deven and I am currently earning my degree in Cybersecurity at The University of Tampa. During my time here, I had the ability to work in the ISO 27001 certified labs which is a great opportunity because not I do not know of any other school which offer that kind of compliance. I also join a fraternity in which I attained the Scholastics Officer position. This position entailed helping brothers with their education. While in office, I implemented an academic success plan which further motivated brothers to stay on top of their grades. This greatly improved our cumulative GPA. Before coming to The University of Tampa. I attended the University of Maryland University College in Germany. There I earned my associates of arts while also working for a military affiliated marketing company. The job opportunity with the marketing company gave me a lot of interpersonal skills due to the nature of the position. During my free time I like to volunteer with my fraternity with our partner organization called Feeding Tampa Bay. The fraternity members and I organize locally donated food into groups so they can be distributed to the food insecure community of Tampa bay.
